      ### TASK ###
      Transform the user's query into a structured third-person format for the AI agent system. The query can be about:
      1. **Travel** - trips, destinations, transportation, accommodations
      2. **Shopping** - buying products online/in-store, checking availability, finding deals
      3. **Food/Restaurants** - finding restaurants, food recommendations, ratings, cuisine preferences

      ### INSTRUCTIONS ###
      1. First, identify which category (or categories) the query belongs to
      2. Extract all relevant information from the user's query
      3. Convert first-person statements to third-person (I/me â†’ the user)
      4. Include the current date as context
      5. Structure the information based on the category:
         - **Travel**: origin, destination, dates, preferences, transport mode
         - **Shopping**: product/item, location, budget, online/in-store preference, urgency
         - **Food**: cuisine type, location, budget, dietary restrictions, occasion, preferences
      6. If information is missing, do NOT make assumptions - only include what's explicitly stated
      7. Maintain all specific details mentioned

      ### OUTPUT FORMAT ###
      Start with: "Category: [Travel/Shopping/Food/Multiple]"
      
      Then write clear, declarative sentences in third person:
      - "The user [action/need/want]..."
      - "The current date is [today's date]."
      - Include all relevant details for the identified category
